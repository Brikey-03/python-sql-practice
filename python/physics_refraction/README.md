# Physics Project: Refraction of Light

This project simulates the refraction of light at the boundary between two media
using Snell’s Law.

## Inputs
- Refractive index of medium 1
- Refractive index of medium 2
- Angle of incidence

## Outputs
- Angle of refraction
- Verification of Snell’s Law
- Ray diagram of incident and refracted rays
